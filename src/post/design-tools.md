<p>It’s fun to see new website design tools that reflect current times and the state of the world. That’s very true this month with new databases devoted to diversity and women in technology, as well and resources to make your design life easier.</p>

<p>Here’s what’s new for designers and developers this month:</p>

<h2>Ztext.Js</h2>

<p><span style="text-decoration:underline">Ztext.js</span> is an easy to implement, three-dimensional typography tool for the web that works with any font you want to use. With the popularity of 3D effects and animation, this tool has a lot of practical applications. Everything you need, including documentation, is available from developer Bennett Feely on his website and GitHub. (It’s free but you can show appreciation with a donation if you like it.)</p>

<h2>Gradient Magic</h2>

<p><span style="text-decoration:underline">Gradient Magic</span> is a free gallery of fun and interesting CSS gradients. You can sort through a random selection or by category of color to find just the right gradient for your project. Some of them would make really neat backgrounds or image overlays.</p>

<h2>Impossible Checkbox</h2>

<p><span style="text-decoration:underline">Impossible Checkbox</span> is a fun little divot that you’ll want to play with and emulate. Click or tap the slider to activate and a nifty little friend pops up. Now here’s the fun part: You can’t leave it checked, and take note of the changing expression of the checkbox character. </p>
